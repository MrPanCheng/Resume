\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
One of my major passions in life is technology. I developed my passion more deeply through undergraduate, master's studies in Software Engineering. During this period I also applied my knowledge and enthusiasm to real-world applications by working in industry as a software engineer. I have a dream that I can do something that has a direct impact on people's lives and makes the world better.

\lettersection{Why Google?}
I believe that as a Google Software Engineer I would have the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge projects that aim at improving people's lives. In addition, working in a company as far-reaching and diverse as Google would allow me to continue doing what I most like in my job in academia, namely facing new challenges on a regular basis and working out innovative solutions.

Finally, I am just a big fan of Google. I like its products (specially Google Search , Google Maps, and Google Books), I like its history (its being born almost by chance), and I share its core principles (in particular \emph{Great just isn't good enough}).

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I have the following qualifications and skills relevant for a Software Engineer position:

\begin{itemize}
	\item BS, MS in Software Engineering.
	\item Solid foundation in computer science, with strong competencies in algorithms and programming languages.
	\item Excellent analytical, troubleshooting, and communication skills.
	\item Experience programming in Java.
\end{itemize}

Altogether, I am convinced that my strong background in software engineering, together with my creativity, enthusiasm, and commitment would be of great value to Google.Thank you for your time. I am hoping for your reply.
